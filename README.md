# San Francisco Real Estate Market Analysis Dashboard
### Intro Analysis Tab
This tab provides a brief intro/overview of the dashboard that has been created and what can be found when navigating through the dashboard. 
The map provided was generated using Mapbox and shows gross rent and sales price per square foot data.  The color bar represents variances in gross rents.  When hovering over each bubble, you can see exact Latitude and Longitude locations, as well as sales price per square foot.  

### Yearly Market Analysis Tab
The three graphs in this tab represent average number of housing units in San Francisco from 2010 - 2016, average gross rent costs, and average sales price data.  
Please excuse the X-axis and Y-axis labels being cut off on the first graph.  They should be "Housing Units" and "Year", respectively.  Panel seems to have cut off data that was on the original graph.  

### Neighborhood Analysis Tab
The first graph in this tab allows you to navigate through different San Francisco neighborhoods and see the trend of average sales price per square foot from 2010 - 2016.  
The second graph is a bar chart showing the top ten most expensive neighborhoods.  This may need to be adjusted to view the full perspecitve of the bars.  Again, this seems to be a Panel issue, as the original graph on the rental_analysis.ipynb displayed the data correctly. 

### Parallel Plots Analysis Tab
The final tab displays parallel coordinate and categories plots.  These plots help offer insight into the relationships between sales price per square foot, number of housing units, gross rent, and neighborhood.  

Hopefully you enjoy the code written and the Panel Dashboard created!
